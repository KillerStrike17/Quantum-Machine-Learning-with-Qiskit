# Quantum-Machine-Learning-with-Qiskit


## To Get Started

To get started you can look into [QC101](QC\ 101/) folder. 
* Here you can start by looking into **Hello World** and **Hello Multiverse** Notebook.
* Then you can look into building your circuit. You can look into **First_Quantum_Circuit** Notebook.
* You can use IBMQ experience to work over actual Quantum Computer. Log in to IBMQ accounnt, and get the key. You can save the key locally so that later you can directly use them. Please look at **IBMQ Check** notebook.
* Now lets move to a bit complex circuit. Lets build half added, try to get the truth table right and then try to build the circuit on your own. Please look at **First_Quantum_Circuit** Notebook if you get stuck somewhere.

You can also look at my session which I delivered over basics of QML. The video is embedded in this [blog](https://medium.com/quantumcomputingindia/quantum-machine-learning-101-5428062822d1) which contains the content of the session.

## Machine Learning

I think by doing the above tasks, you should be knowing the basics of QC and can proceed to perform simple Machine Learning Task. Lets start with classification.

### [Classification](Classification/)

Lets try our hands on the QSVM, one of the oldest classifier of Classical Machine Learning. 
* Please move to **QSVM** notebook. It is a simple classifier build over Z Featuremap, ZZ Feature Map, Pauli Feature Map and Custom Feature Map over binary and Multiclass dataset. I have delivered a session over QML, you can have a look of it at this [blog](https://medium.com/quantumcomputingindia/quantum-machine-learning-102-qsvm-using-qiskit-731956231a54).
* Now we attempt the classification problem with another algorithm called VQC. VQC gives us more flexibility with optimizers, so lets try it over a subset of MNIST Dataset. Please headover to **VQC** notebook.
